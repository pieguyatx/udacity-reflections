When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This is useful when you are working on a project from multiple computers, or when multiple people are working on the same project.  It also could be useful if you just want a backup for your projects online, or if you want to publicize or open-source a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You might have made changes locally that haven't been committed to a branch yet, and pulling changes from a remote might conflict with that.
